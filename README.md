# common algorithms and data structures and design patterns

Implementation of the most common programming algorithms in different languages

If you are new to programming, then this repo is your starting point to become a better programmer.

# how to use this repository?

According to the list below, start reading the readme of each part and try to write a code for that algorithm or data structure. After that (or if you couldn't write the code yourself) check my codes.

If your code is better than mine or yours is in another language that does not exist here, please create a pull request and add your codes.

Also if you know another algorithm or data structure that was not in here, create a pull request and add it to this repo.
